# NYC311 (Phone Call Tracking System Data)

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beanumber/nyc311.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/beanumber/nyc311)

`nyc311` is a R package based on ETL framework to interface with NYC311 Phone call tracking system data. This package contains information collected from [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/fhrw-4uyv), and it allows users to download multiple years of phone call data to a local SQL database. 

NYC Open Data Portal updates NYC311 dataset everyday, so users can get access to phone call information from 2010-01-10 to yesterday.

This package uses the [etl](http://github.com/beanumber/etl) database framework.

Please read [the vignette](https://github.com/beanumber/nyc311/blob/master/vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd) to get started.
