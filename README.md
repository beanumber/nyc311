# nyc311

`nyc311` is a R package that contains phone call information from [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/fhrw-4uyv), and it allows ursers to upload multiple years of monthly phone call data to a local SQL database. 

NYC Open Data Portal updates this dataset everyday, so ursers can get access to phone call information from 2010-01-10 to yesterday.

This package uses the [etl](http://github.com/beanumber/etl) database framework.

Please see [the vignette](https://github.com/beanumber/nyc311/blob/master/vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd) to get started.
